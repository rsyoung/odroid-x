v1:
* Added SIO Scheduler (Faster IO on Flash devices)
* Disabled FRAME_POINTER, it can slow the kernel down
* Built Using -ffast-match
* Decreased IO Latency to Solid State drives 
* Better KSM Tunning (Apps with real multi-thread such as native ffmpeg
* should perform better) 
* Latest lowmemorykiller

v2:
* Same as V1 plus:
* Compile VFP as Neon
* Makefile: Make use of neon and A9 instructions when ever its possible
* Disabled MMC_CAP_ERASE: Since its a dev board, just wipe it yourself. This
* may cause issues with Samsung and Flash devices. (Disabled only on eMMC).
* Its enabled on the SDCARD.
* CPU unaligned access path -> Should Increase SIMD speed. (from 1.2x to
* 3.8x) Very useful while soft decoding videos, if the codecs use it.
* Patched and Optimized CRC32 algorithm.

v3:
* BFQ IO Scheduler
* Tweaked BFQ IO Scheduler to get better performance on flash devices
* SLQB allocator
* Complete MALI port from SGS 3 sources, its newer.. as well plenty of code
* Clean up on MALI drivers
* Cleaned all DEBUG stuff that Samsung coded on Mali Driver and wasn't in use


4:
3.0.41 kernel
Implemented WasActive page flag
More Makefile optimizations

By default I have enabled the CIFS support so we can mount windows share's on Android.
By doing this you get more performance to watch videos that are on Samba Shares.
You can use the app Cifs Manager from market to have a nice UI. 

4patch1:
CFQ IO scheduler was causing kernel panic due to bad patching. -> FIXED
BFQ IO Scheduler wasn't setted as default -> FIXED
Wireless wasnt working -> Fine, we need to recompile the driver, new kernel new driver
the new zImage, new kernel source fixed, binary driver for wifi (including
respecting the previous path for the "TXT" required by the driver)
Also provided the Wifi sources. I've patched it to be less chatty.


4.1: *UNTESTED*
arch/arm/kernel: disable preemption in machine_shutdown - found by google
mm/backing-dev: use synchronize_rcu_expedited instead of synchronize_rcu
fs/ext4: fix data corruption in inodes with journalled data
fs/ext4: Fix overflow caused by missing cast in ext4_fallocate()
fs/ext4: fix races in ext4_sync_parent()
mm/page-writeback: remove useless rcu lock-unlock from mapping_tagged()
tmpfs: clone shmem_file_splice_read()
tmpfs: refine shmem_file_splice_read
tmpfs: pass gfp to shmem_getpage_gfp
tmpfs: remove_shmem_readpage
tmpfs: simplify prealloc_page
tmpfs: simplify filepage/swappage
writeback: account NR_WRITTEN at IO completion time
mm/slqc: Fixed the use of a deprecated function

new Wifi driver even less chatty.
